This is the 24th newsletter of the [Embedded WG] where we highlight new progress, celebrate cool projects, thank the community, and advertise projects that need help!

We've been on an unscheduled hiatus for the past six months or so, but it's time for us to return! Today we're doing a quick fast-forward of all of the great things that have been released while we've been on break.

For the next few weeks, we'll be doing a special "catch-up" schedule, meaning we'll be releasing articles weekly until we've caught up with all of the recent changes. Once we've wrapped that up, we'll go back to a regular monthly cadence.

We've also added a few new folks to the [resources team](#), say hello to [@hargoniX](#), [@eldruin](#), and [@kalkyl](#), who will be helping out with the newsletter!
