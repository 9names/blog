## Embedded Projects


* [Jens Reimann] has assembled a [docker image] for developing Rust on the ESP8266 and ESP32 series of devices, including stable `alloc` support!

[docker image]: https://github.com/ctron/rust-esp-container/

* [Lucas Brendel] working on peripheral access crates as well as a shared embedded HAL for the Infineon XMC4 series of microcontrollers in the [xmc-rs organization]. Peripheral access crates are available and the HAL is in the very early stages of development.

* [42 Technology] have published the source code for their Nordic [nRF9160 demonstration application], along with a Rust crate which wraps up Nordic's proprietary C driver library. They also have a piece comparing Embedded Rust and Embedded C published in the German language magazine [IOT Design] this month.

* [theJPster]'s [Monotron] got a write-up in [Hackaday]. Moves are also afoot for a next-generation Monotron - codename [Neotron 1000] - complete with a book! Check it out if you're interested developing a modern-day version of CP/M, written in Rust.

* [probe-rs] finally has released on crates.io. The library enables you to inspect, debug and flash ARM cores. Flash the ARM core your future embedded Rust project with [cargo-flash], fully integrated into cargo. Flashing works for the **nRF51822, nRF52832, nRF52840, STMF042 and STMF429xI** using a **DAPLink** or an **ST-Link**.
The upcomming 0.3.0 release will also enable your to flash any ARM core (provided an an ARM CMSIS-Pack exists in a known registry).

If you have an embedded project or blog post you would like to have featured in the Embedded WG Newsletter, make sure to add it to [the next newsletter], we would love to show it off!
