## Highlights

<!-- TODO Add news related to embedded Rust that are not about new crates releases here -->

- [embedded-hal-mock](https://github.com/dbrgn/embedded-hal-mock/) has released 0.7.1 on crates.io with [support for error expectations](https://docs.rs/embedded-hal-mock/0.7.1/embedded_hal_mock/i2c/index.html#testing-error-handling). This means that you can now unit test the error handling logic of your embedded-hal driver crates.

- TODO(remove, this is an example) "const generics" has landed in nightly!

- TODO(remove, this is an example) the Rust compiler has gained cross compilation support for the Xtensa architecture!

## Embedded Projects

- [@almindor] released a platform-agnostic [driver for the MAX7219][max7219-driver] segmented display and published a [blog post][max7219-blog-post] including a picture of an example setup. 

- [@rubberduck203][@rubberduck203] added VS Code configurations to the [cortex-m-quickstart][cortex-m-quickstart] and published a [blog post][vscode-blog]. Debugging Cortex-M projects in editor with VS Code now works out of the box.

- [@jkristell] released version 0.6 of the [Infrared][infrared] crate and published a [blog post][infrared-blog] on how to add remote control support to an embedded Rust project.

- [@lupyuen] has been doing very cool things with Rust and the PineTime smart watch - see [Porting druid Rust Widgets to PineTime Smart Watch](https://medium.com/@ly.lee/porting-druid-rust-widgets-to-pinetime-smart-watch-7e1d5a5d977a) and [Optimising PineTime’s Display Driver with Rust and Mynewt](https://medium.com/@ly.lee/optimising-pinetimes-display-driver-with-rust-and-mynewt-3ba269ea2f5c?source=friends_link&sk=4d2cbd2e6cd2343eed62d214814f7b81).

- [The Raspberry Pi OS dev tutorial] got a new chapter on Kernel Unit, Integration and Console tests using QEMU

- Steven Walter gave a talk at [Rust Belt Rust][rust-belt-rust] about [introducing Rust into an existing embedded Linux project][introducing-rust-into-legacy].

- [@arosspope](https://github.com/arosspope) released an implementation of [the game snake for the stm32f3 discovery board](https://github.com/arosspope/usnake) using RTFM.

- Rust firmware for [Stabilizer](https://github.com/quartiq/stabilizer) has been released. [Stabilizer](https://github.com/sinara-hw/Stabilizer/wiki) is an open hardware, high speed, multi channel, STM32H743 based feedback controller for Quantum Physics applications. The firmware features [RTFM v0.5](https://github.com/rtfm-rs/cortex-m-rtfm) and [smoltcp](https://github.com/m-labs/smoltcp). Support for several analog front end mezzanines like current stabilization or Pound-Drever-Hall locks is being developed.
