## Highlights

- [Last Month in Flott](https://flott-motion.org/news/last-month-in-flott-may-2021/), the monthly newsletter for Flott has been published. Flott is an open source toolkit for motion control software in Rust (designed to run everywhere, including microcontrollers).

- The [microbit crate](https://crates.io/crates/microbit) has released v0.9.0, moved under the [nrf-rs](https://github.com/nrf-rs/microbit) organisational umbrella, **and** gained [micro:bit v2](https://github.com/nrf-rs/microbit/pull/44) support. ðŸŽ‰
- The [switch-hal crate](https://crates.io/crates/switch-hal) released v0.4.0, adding [StatefulOutputSwitch](https://docs.rs/switch-hal/0.4.0/switch_hal/trait.StatefulOutputSwitch.html) for platforms that support `StatefulOutputPin`.
- The [probe-rs](https://probe.rs) project, which provides debugging and flash programming for a variety of embedded targets, released version [v0.11.0](https://probe.rs/blog/release-0-11-0/), with a number of performance and functionality improvements.
- [cortex-m](https://crates.io/crates/cortex-m) released version 0.7.3, improving ease-of-use for the `Delay` implementation and fixing native builds on non-x86 hosts.
- [cortex-m-rt](https://crates.io/crates/cortex-m-rt) released version 0.6.15, backporting various fixes to the linker script and helping prepare for a new 0.7 release soon.
- [cross](https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross) has posted a [call for help](https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross/issues/574) looking for new maintainers: if you use cross and would like to help out, please check it out!

## Embedded Projects

If you have an embedded project or blog post you would like to have featured in the Embedded WG Newsletter, make sure to add it to [the next newsletter], we would love to show it off!

- [Windfisch] published their [Midikraken], an extensible up-to-16-port MIDI-USB-Interface that also will support standalone operation (e.g. MIDI routing) soon. The project uses Rust's RTIC framework to drive a STM32F103 microcontroller board (a.k.a. "Blue Pill") and is open-source and open-hardware. The firmware is in active development and lots of cool new features are down the way! Kits for self-assembly will likely be sold some day in the future.
