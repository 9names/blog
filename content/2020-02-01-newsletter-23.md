## Highlights

- [@lupyuen] has been doing very cool things with Rust and the PineTime smart watch - see [Porting druid Rust Widgets to PineTime Smart Watch] and [Optimising PineTime’s Display Driver with Rust and Mynewt].
- [The Raspberry Pi OS dev tutorial] got a new chapter on Kernel Unit, Integration and Console tests using QEMU
- Google announced [OpenSK], an open source security key based on [TockOS] in Embedded Rust
- [Ferrous Systems] announced the second iteration of [Oxidize], an embedded Rust conference in Berlin Germany, will take place in July of 2020. Read the [Announcement Blog Post] for more details
- [PLCnext] shared a [Sample Rust Runtime] and a how-to guide for running deterministic real-time Rust
 on an industrial Linux device

## Embedded Projects

- [@almindor] released a platform-agnostic [driver for the MAX7219][max7219-driver] segmented display and published a [blog post][max7219-blog-post] including a picture of an example setup.
- [embedded-hal-mock] has released 0.7.1 on crates.io with [support for error expectations]. This means that you can now unit test the error handling logic of your embedded-hal driver crates.
- [@rubberduck203][@rubberduck203] added VS Code configurations to the [cortex-m-quickstart][cortex-m-quickstart] and published a [blog post][vscode-blog]. Debugging Cortex-M projects in editor with VS Code now works out of the box.
- [@rubberduck203][@rubberduck203] released a [quickstart template for the STM32F3DISCOVERY board][stm32f3-quickstart] with pre-configured linker script & build targets.
- [@jkristell] released version 0.6 of the [Infrared][infrared] crate and published a [blog post][infrared-blog] on how to add remote control support to an embedded Rust project.
- Steven Walter gave a talk at [Rust Belt Rust][rust-belt-rust] about [introducing Rust into an existing embedded Linux project][introducing-rust-into-legacy].
- [@arosspope] released an implementation of [the game snake for the stm32f3 discovery board] using RTFM.
- Rust firmware for [Stabilizer] has been released. [Stabilizer][stabilizer-wiki] is an open hardware, high speed, multi channel, STM32H743 based feedback controller for Quantum Physics applications. The firmware features [RTFM v0.5] and [smoltcp]. Support for several analog front end mezzanines like current stabilization or Pound-Drever-Hall locks is being developed.
- [@42technology] announced they have ported Cloudflare's Rust-language [QUIC] library (known as '[quiche]') to the Nordic nRF9160, producing possibly the world's first QUIC demonstration on that platform.
- [atsamd-hal] 0.8.2 released, which includes work by [@twitchyliquid64] and [@jacobrosenthal] implementing USB support for SAMD21 and SAMD51 devices.
- [@Disasm] released [longan-nano] and [seedstudio-gd32v] board support crates with examples for the corresponding RISC-V boards.
