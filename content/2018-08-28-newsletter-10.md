## Highlights

* We have [a blog]! We'll be posting newsletters, notices for upcoming changes, and embedded related articles there in the upcoming future. Use RSS? It has an [RSS feed]! Check out the [blog on github] to make any corrections or to contribute an article
* Nightly Rust has [switched to `lld`] for Cortex-M targets as a default. See the blog post for how to handle this change
* There have been updates to [`cortex-m`], [`cortex-m-rt`], and [`cortex-m-quickstart`]! Check out the linked changelogs to see what is new. Also, the latest release of each of these no longer require `arm-none-eabi-gcc`!
