## Highlights

<!-- TODO Add news related to embedded Rust that are not about new crates releases here -->

- The [embedded showcase] gained its first entry! The [rusty clock] project, an alarm clock that features pressure, temperature and humidity on an e-paper display and 5 programmable alarms. We are still looking for cool embedded projects to serve that can serve as examples of what can be done in Rust. Don't hesitate to [submit] yours!

- TODO(remove, this is an example) "const generics" has landed in nightly!

- TODO(remove, this is an example) the Rust compiler has gained cross compilation support for the Xtensa architecture!

## Embedded Projects

<!-- TODO Add news about embedded projects here -->

- [@jjkt](https://github.com/jjkt) is working on [`zmu`](https://github.com/jjkt/zmu), an emulator for microcontroller based systems. Zmu is work in progress but can already emulate substantial parts of Cortex M - based MCUs core architecture features.

- [@japaric][] [released][call-stack-twitter] [v0.1.2][call-stack-changelog] of [`cargo-call-stack`][call-stack-crates-io], a static stack usage analyzer, and published a [blog post][call-stack-blog-post] with details about its implementation.
