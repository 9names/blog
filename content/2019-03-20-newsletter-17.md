## Highlights

- The [embedded showcase] gained its first entry! The [rusty clock] project, an alarm clock that features pressure, temperature and humidity on an e-paper display and 5 programmable alarms. We are still looking for cool embedded projects to serve that can serve as examples of what can be done in Rust. Don't hesitate to [submit] yours!
- [OxidizeConf], the first embedded Rust conference, has announced speakers! Check out [the lineup here]!
- [Antoine van Gelder] wrote about using Peripheral Access Crates to [program interrupts] on the STM32F3 Discovery board
- [James Munns] gave a talk at Rust Berlin about what happens [before `main()`] in embedded Rust projects

## Embedded Projects

- [@jjkt](https://github.com/jjkt) is working on [`zmu`](https://github.com/jjkt/zmu), an emulator for microcontroller based systems. Zmu is work in progress but can already emulate substantial parts of Cortex M - based MCUs core architecture features.

- [@japaric][] [released][call-stack-twitter] [v0.1.2][call-stack-changelog] of [`cargo-call-stack`][call-stack-crates-io], a static stack usage analyzer, and published a [blog post][call-stack-blog-post] with details about its implementation.

- [Wesley Moore] wrote [a blog post] about getting Rust running on the TI SensorTag, see the [project on sourcehut]!

If you have an embedded project or blog post you would like to have featured in the Embedded WG Newsletter, make sure to add it to [the next newsletter], we would love to show it off!
