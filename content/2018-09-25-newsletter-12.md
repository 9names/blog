## Highlights

* We now have a category for Embedded on the [users.rust-lang.org] forum! This is a great place to ask larger questions, or to share more details about your projects!
* You can now build embedded [binaries on stable] with the `1.30-beta` release of Rust! Check it out and let us know if you run in to any issues with your projects!

## Embedded Projects

If you have an embedded project or blog post you would like to have featured in the Embedded WG Newsletter, make sure to mention it on the tracking issue for [the next newsletter], we would love to show it off!

* [Diego Barrios Romero] has released his [eeprom24x] crate, an `embedded-hal` compatible driver for EEPROM memory chips such as the Microchip/Atmel `AT24C32`, `24AA32A`, `AT24C256`, or STMicroelectronics' `M24C32`
* [Trangar] managed to drive [56 ArtNet Torches] using Rust, based on his [ArtNet Protocol] crate
* The `no_std` synthesizer from the last newsletter has been implemented on-hardware by [Jonathan Pallant], giving the [Monotron] a [PWM audio driver]!
