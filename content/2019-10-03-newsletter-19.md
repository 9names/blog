## Highlights

<!-- TODO Add news related to embedded Rust that are not about new crates releases here -->

- TODO(remove, this is an example) "const generics" has landed in nightly!

- TODO(remove, this is an example) the Rust compiler has gained cross compilation support for the Xtensa architecture!

## Embedded Projects

- Google is working on a [Coreboot](https://www.coreboot.org/) replacement called [Oreboot](https://github.com/oreboot/oreboot), i.e. Coreboot minus the 'C'. Slides for a talk [about oreboot](https://osfc.io/uploads/talk/paper/23/Oreboot.pdf) are also available.

- [@eldruin] released a platform-agnostic [driver for the VEML6075][veml6075-driver] UVA and UVB light sensor (so you can optimize your suntan) and published a [blog post][veml6075-blog-post] with some pictures of the device in action.

- [@therealprof] wrote a [blog post][digital::v2 blog post] about porting an [Embedded HAL][embedded-hal] impl of the digital::v1 traits for GPIOs to digital::v2.

If you have an embedded project or blog post you would like to have featured in the Embedded WG Newsletter, make sure to add it to [the next newsletter], we would love to show it off!
