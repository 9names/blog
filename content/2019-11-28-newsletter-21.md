## Highlights

<!-- TODO Add news related to embedded Rust that are not about new crates releases here -->

- [@jamesmunns] streamed some work on developing interrupt and panic code [on youtube]

- TODO(remove, this is an example) "const generics" has landed in nightly!

- TODO(remove, this is an example) the Rust compiler has gained cross compilation support for the Xtensa architecture!

## Embedded Projects

- [@eldruin] released a platform-agnostic [driver for the OPT300x][opt300x-driver] family of ambient light sensors and published a [blog post][opt300x-blog-post] with a picture of the device taking lux measurements.
- @mciantyre published a custom runtime and peripheral access crates to support development on the Teensy 4. Check out [the repo][teensy4-rs] to see how it works, discuss the approach, and try it out.

- [@japaric] released version v0.1.0 of [`ufmt`], a smaller (6-40x) and faster (2-9x) alternative to `core::fmt` that's free of dynamic dispatch, recursion (where possible) and panicking branches. `ufmt` is *not* a drop-in replacement for `core::fmt` but it provides `uDebug` and `uDisplay` traits and a family of `uwrite!` macros. In this release the `uwrite!` macros, and the rest of the crate, work on the stable channel.

- [@andre-richter] added two new tutorials for the `Operating System development tutorials in Rust on the Raspberry Pi` series:
    - Tutorial 11: [Virtual Memory](https://github.com/rust-embedded/rust-raspi3-OS-tutorials/tree/master/11_virtual_memory)
    - Tutorial 12: [CPU Exceptions: Part 1](https://github.com/rust-embedded/rust-raspi3-OS-tutorials/tree/master/12_cpu_exceptions_part1)
    
- [@jamesmunns] released two embedded crates:
    - [`panic-persist`]: A panic handler crate inspired by `panic-ramdump` that logs panic messages to a region of RAM defined by the user, allowing for discovery of panic messages post-mortem using normal program control flow.
    - [`cmim`], or Cortex-M Interrupt Move: A crate for Cortex-M devices to move data to interrupt context, without needing a critical section to access the data within an interrupt, and to remove the need for the "mutex dance"
