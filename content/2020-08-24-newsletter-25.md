This is the 25th newsletter of the [Embedded WG] where we highlight new progress, celebrate cool projects, thank the community, and advertise projects that need help!

As a note, some of these stories have happened over the past months. We're still working on catching up, but wanted to share them with you!

[Embedded WG]: https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg

Discuss on [#rust-embedded:matrix.org], [users.rust-lang.org], [on twitter], or [on reddit]!

## Highlights

- [@hannobraun][@braun-embedded] wrote an [article about his DW1000 driver][dw1000].
- [@andre-richter] added a new tutorial to the [Operating System development tutorials in Rust on the Raspberry Pi] series:
  - [Tutorial 14: Exceptions Part 2: Peripheral IRQs] - Including drivers for the BCM and GICv2 interrupt controllers.
- In recent nightlies,`rust-std` support for the two `bare-metal` `aarch64` targets [has landed][aarch64-rust-std].
  - Add them using `rustup target add aarch64-unknown-none-softfloat` or `rustup target add aarch64-unknown-none`.
  - [See it in action here][os-dev-rust-std] for building a kernel without the need for third-party tools like `xbuild` or `xargo`.
- [@therealprof][@therealprof] wrote an [introduction article about the "USB-C pill"][USB-C pill].
- [@bobmcwhirter][@bobmcwhirter] wrote an article about using an [ESP8266 as a WiFi offload with an STM32F401RE][wifi-offload]
- [Ferrous Systems] released [defmt], a highly efficient Rust logging framework for embedded devices

## Embedded Projects

- [@rubberduck203][@rubberduck203] released the experimental [switch-hal crate][switch-hal], which provides a zero-cost abstraction over Active High/Active Low GPIO, allowing application developers to more clearly express their intent and for drivers to avoid making runtime decisions about driving a line high or low based on the pin's active level.
- [@rubberduck203][@rubberduck203] has also released the [stm32f3-discovery board support crate][stm32f3-discovery] as an alternative to the unmaintained `f3` crate.
- The [stm32f3-discovery-quickstart][stm32f3-discovery-quickstart] template has been updated to utilize both the [stm32f3-discovery board support crate][stm32f3-discovery] and the [switch-hal crate][switch-hal]. It also now includes VS Code tasks for cleaning, building examples, and building in release mode.
- [@proman21][@proman21] has released a beta version of [samd-timer][samd-timer], an abstraction for the Timer peripherals present on Atmel SAM microcontrollers. This library provides lower-level control over these timers than [atsamd-hal][atsamd-hal], while remaining compatible with the HAL clock system.
- [@dbrgn][@dbrgn] and [@rnestler][@rnestler] released a first version of the [shtcx](https://docs.rs/shtcx/) embedded-hal driver for Sensirion SHTCx series humidity/temperature sensors. The driver is feature-complete, but currently supports only a blocking API. The crate will be updated with an alternative non-blocking API soon.
- [@ra-kete][@ra-kete] released the [microfft crate][microfft], a library for computing fast fourier transforms on embedded devices.
- [@dajamante][@dajamante] added an [obstacle avoiding robot](https://github.com/Dajamante/avr-car) with more [details in this article](https://github.com/Dajamante/avr-car/blob/master/article.md).
- [@therealprof][@therealprof] released the [display-interface crate][display-interface], an abstraction over the different possibilities to drive a display.
- [@bugadani][@bugadani] released the [embedded-text crate][embedded-text], a text rendering library built on top of [embedded-graphics][embedded-graphics].
- [@bobmcwhirter][@bobmcwhirter] released the [drogue-esp8266][drogue-esp8266], a WiFi-offload embedded-nal implementation crate.

If you have an embedded project or blog post you would like to have featured in the Embedded WG Newsletter, make sure to add it to [the next newsletter], we would love to show it off!
