## Highlights

<!-- TODO Add news related to embedded Rust that are not about new crates releases here -->

- TODO(remove, this is an example) "const generics" has landed in nightly!

- TODO(remove, this is an example) the Rust compiler has gained cross compilation support for the Xtensa architecture!

## Embedded Projects

- [@andre-richter] released v0.1.0 of [`qemu-exit`]. This library provides functions to gracefully exit a running QEMU session from within your Rust binary with an user-defined exit code. This can be used for unit or integration tests that run inside QEMU. Currently supports `aarch64` and `x86_64` architectures. 

- [@eldruin] released a platform-agnostic [driver for the Si4703][si4703-driver] FM radio turner (receiver) and published a [blog post][si4703-blog-post] including a picture of an example setup.

- [@eldruin] released a platform-agnostic [driver for the PCA9685][pca9685-driver] PWM LED/Servo controller driver and published a [blog post][pca9685-blog-post] including a video of the device controlling RGB LEDs and several Servo motors simultaneously.
