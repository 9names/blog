## Highlights

<!-- TODO Add news related to embedded Rust that are not about new crates releases here -->

- TODO(remove, this is an example) "const generics" has landed in nightly!

- TODO(remove, this is an example) the Rust compiler has gained cross compilation support for the Xtensa architecture!

- We've had a bunch of Embedded Rust related events over the past couple of months. EWG member @thejpster was at ACCU 2019 (the Association of C and C++ Users Annual Conference), in Bristol, UK, on 12 April, delivering a talk on Embeddded Rust and the Monotron. Jonathan was then speaking at the Centre for Computing History in Cambridge, UK on 18 April, followed by hosting Oxidize at the end of April! Next up, Monotron is visiting Rust Conf in Portland, USA in late August. Don't forget, if you've been giving or attending Embedded Rust talks, drop us a line for the next newsletter!

- [The embedded showcase](https://rust-embedded.github.io/showcase/) gained 3 new entries! We are still looking for cool embedded projects to serve that can serve as examples of what can be done in Rust. Don't hesitate to [submit yours](https://github.com/rust-embedded/showcase#submit-your-project)!

## Embedded Projects

<!-- TODO Add news about embedded projects here -->

- [@laanwj], [@Disasm] and [@burrbull] are working on [Rust support for the Kendryte K210 RISC-V chips](https://github.com/riscv-rust/k210-crates).

- [@Disasm] and [@almindor] updated [riscv-rust-quickstart]: now you can run Rust on the HiFive1 Rev B board.

- [@Disasm] released [stm32-usbd]: a fork of [stm32f103xx-usb] adopted for multiple STM32 device families.
