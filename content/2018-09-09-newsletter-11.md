## Highlights

* `rustc` now supports 4 **Cortex-R** targets thanks to the work of [paoloteti] in the Cortex-R space! You can build programs for these targets using nothing but the Rust toolchain
* [James Munns] gave a talk [at RustConf 2018], covering the basics of embedded systems, and how Rust's Zero Cost Abstractions are a perfect match for bare metal systems

## Embedded Projects

If you have an embedded project or blog post you would like to have featured in the Embedded WG Newsletter, make sure to mention it on the tracking issue for [the next newsletter], we would love to show it off!

* Support for the Arduino MKRZERO board [has landed] in the [atsamd21-rs] repository! This is a Board Support Crate for various development board based on the Atmel/Microchip samd21 Cortex-M microcontroller
* [Branan Riley] is working on the [fourth chapter] of his [Exploring Rust on Teensy] series, which will focus on using `futures-rs` to represent DMA transfers
* [Emil Fresk] shared some shots of his next [Visual Inertial PCB], which includes an STM32 running control algorithms written in Rust!
* [Jonathan Pallant] added a bare-metal [four-channel synthesizer] for his Monotron project, and even included a short [demo audio clip]!
