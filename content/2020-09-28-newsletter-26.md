## Highlights

<!--
TODO Add news related to embedded Rust that are not about new crates releases here. Things that go here include:

    * Blog Posts
    * Proof of concepts
    * Product releases
    * Upstream changes/releases
-->

- TODO(remove, this is an example) "const generics" has landed in nightly!

- TODO(remove, this is an example) the Rust compiler has gained cross compilation support for the Xtensa architecture!

- [@cecton] wrote a blog post targeted to experienced developers but embedded development beginners: [Rust, Arduino and Embedded Development as a Beginner: Part 1]

- [@brainstorm] and [@joshajohnson] Created a RTIC example for an HID mouse with a blackberry trackball [bbtrackball-rs].

- The [knurling-rs] tooling initiative by [Ferrous Systems] has grown: after [`defmt`], the project has publicly released three new tools:
    * [`flip-link`], a linker wrapper that adds zero-cost stack overflow protection to your project
    * [`probe-run`], a Cargo runner that seamlessly runs embedded programs on your target device as if they were native ones
    * [`defmt-test`], a proc-macro to write and run unit tests on embedded devices

## Embedded Projects

<!--
TODO Add news about embedded projects here. Things that
go here include:

    * New crates
    * New releases of existing crates
    * Embedded Application releases
-->

If you have an embedded project or blog post you would like to have featured in the Embedded WG Newsletter, make sure to add it to [the next newsletter], we would love to show it off!

- TODO(remove, this is an example) Crate embedded-foo has released version 1.0.0!

- [@eldruin] released a platform-agnostic [driver for the CCS811][ccs811-driver] indoor air quality sensor and published a [blog post][ccs811-blog-post] including example setups.
- [@diondokter] released a first version of [device-driver] which can aid driver developers in developing device drivers. For now only register interfaces are supported as is laid out in [this twitter thread][device-driver-thread].
